# Compiler-Design-
An Assignment for a Compiler Design module

The tastier compiler was where most of the work was done and includes a grammar from which I added the String data type, 
a basic form of structs, arrays, switch statements, a conditional assignment statement and a few othe implementations.

The tastier machine was written by one of my lecturers in order to help with the module.
